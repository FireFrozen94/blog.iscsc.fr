Before reading this article, it's recommended to have a minimum knowledge of `docker`.  
See, for example, the previous blog on docker: [Get Started with Docker](https://iscsc.fr/posts/short-docker-introduction/) by `ctmbl`.

## What is a Docker's volume?

A docker's volume is the action of **mounting an existing file or directory** of the host (the computer running the container) **into a container**. To rephrase, it enables a container to **share a memory space with the host**. So both the container and the user can access and modify it in real time and because it's not "contained" in the container but only mounted, it'll **persist after the container's death**.

## Why do we need volumes?

Docker containerization is very useful on lots of points for development but it's very annoying if your application **needs to produce persistent data**, like logs. Indeed if you **kill** your container (to update it for example) or if it **crashes**, you **lose everything that was inside** and understanding why your application crashed without its logs can be very complicated or even impossible.

So we need to find a way to **keep certain files after the container's death** and that can be **achieved with volumes**!.

## How to create a volume?

To create a volume, you need to add a specific argument to the `docker run` command.

> You can also create volumes outside of containers with [`docker volume`](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#create-and-manage-volumes)

There is two different arguments which are really similar in their use. Those are `--mount` and `--volume`, both can be used to create volumes (or bind mounts, see Disclaimer above).  
However they slightly differ: if you enter a non existing file to mount, `--volume` will create it when `--mount` will return an error, also `--volume` needs fewer arguments. For these reason and because we focused on volumes in this post we'll describe the `--volume` argument. 

The exact syntax is:
```bash
docker run <other args> --volume PATH_TO_HOST_FILE:PATH_TO_CONTAINER_FILE:<optional args>
```

> Note that you can use `-v` instead of `--volume`.

> Note that you can mount a directory instead of a file with the same method.

> A similar syntax exists for [`docker-compose.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes)

Optional args must be separated by comas, they are not used very often but lets detail the most useful one quickly :
- `ro` : if used, the mounted files/folders will be in read only mode inside the container

A concrete example with the [code of our RootMe discord bot](https://github.com/iScsc/RootPythia/blob/2681ca26286ea5063371536e995a5e3cf39734a5/run.sh#L12):
```bash
    source ./.env.prod

    docker run --rm --interactive --tty \
	--detach \
	--volume $(realpath -P ${LOG_FOLDER}):/opt/${NAME}/logs \
	--env-file .env.prod \
	--name ${NAME} \
	${NAME}:latest
```
In this example `LOG_FOLDER` is an environment variable defined in the `.env.prod` file.  
The code will write transparently to `/opt/${NAME}/logs/<log file>` but because this folder is shared with the host, logs will **be available in the host** and survive potential application crashes or updates.

> **WARNING : Be careful that the bot/application running in the container must have the right permission to modify the file/directory**

## Other important use cases of volumes

* The same volume can be shared by multiple containers.  
 It can be useful if you want to share a database with applications running on different containers or to centralized logs of multiple application in the same log file/folder.
* In development you can use volumes to share code with the container (where it runs) while editing it in your IDE in the host.
* Volumes exist and can be created/managed outside of a container (contrary to bind mounts) with `docker volume`
* Volumes are entirely managed by Docker and are then OS-agnostic
